Title: Internships, Networking, and Navigating Spaces Not Built for Us
Author: Anjali Saravanan

Everything about my first internship excited me — moving to a new city, meeting new people, being part of the corporate world, 
and working alongside professional data engineers. It felt like a major turning point in my academic and professional life. 
I was so thrilled that I didn’t realize how overwhelming and intimidating this new environment could be. 
I sometimes felt out of place, especially when I was surrounded by people who seemed smarter and more confident than I was. 
I constantly doubted myself and wondered if I really belonged there.

Over time, I realized that it’s completely normal to feel this way when stepping out of your comfort zone. 
I began to understand that it’s okay not to have all the answers at the start and to learn things at my own pace. 
Networking with my colleagues and asking questions helped me become more self-confident, 
and I started to contribute my own ideas more freely. Each conversation taught me something valuable and helped me feel 
more connected to my team. Even when I found myself in spaces that weren’t built for me, I learned to speak up — even when 
I felt uncertain.

This experience taught me to trust my abilities and reminded me that speaking up is not just important, but empowering.
