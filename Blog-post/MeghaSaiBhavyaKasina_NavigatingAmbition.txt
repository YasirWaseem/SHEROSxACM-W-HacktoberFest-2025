Topic: Navigating Academic Ambition
Author: Megha Sai Bhavya Kasina

The decision of opting for a Masterâ€™s degree in the U.S.A, and that too, leaving India, 
was not only a career choice but also a gamble that all of us had to take together. 
The pressure to perform got instantly doubled because of that one decision, which in turn, 
made my ambition feel associated with more than merely my personal success.

The internal bar I set when I started with my post-graduate studies was a minimum of 95% in all the subjects. 
This overwhelming desire, though energizing, originates from the thought that being a woman of color and an international student 
in a tough field like Cybersecurity, I have to always prove my place. Sometimes I feel my performance is bigger than myself.
This insistence on excellence invariably leads to the dedication being converted into high anxiety.

I got to know that the need for being perfect always has the opposite effect and creates anxiety rather than timely. 
The 'Aha' moment came when I understood the pressure as a huge backpack and at times dropping 
it is the best way to take care of oneself.

Shifting my focus from the search for flawless execution to the celebration of meaningful 
effort and true understanding has been my way of life now. I still set high standards, but 
I make sure to tell myself that a minor error is a part of learning and not a failure of character. 
True success is eternal and everlasting ambition requires the right approach.

If you are feeling the same way, then here is a reminder: Your worth is not measured by the grade you got on your report card. 
Your inquisitiveness, toughness, and one-of-a-kind point of view are the greatest assets that you bring to the technology world.
