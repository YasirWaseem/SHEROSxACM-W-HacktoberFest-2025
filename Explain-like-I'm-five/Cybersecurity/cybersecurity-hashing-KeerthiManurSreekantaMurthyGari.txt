Hashing and Integrity

Hashing is a way to take any piece of data, including a message, a file, or even a password, and 
convert it into a fixed-size string of characters, often called a hash or digest. Think of it like a digital 
fingerprint: each unique input produces a unique hash. Even the smallest change to the original data will create a 
completely different hash, which makes hashing ideal for checking integrity. For example, when you download software, 
the website often provides a hash of the file so you can verify that your download hasn’t been corrupted or tampered with.

Unlike encryption, hashing is one-way: you can’t reverse it to recover the original input. This property makes it extremely 
useful for storing sensitive information like passwords. Instead of saving the password itself, systems store its hash. 
During login, the system hashes the entered password and compares it with the stored hash. If they match, the password is 
correct — even though the system never knows the original password.

Hashes are also a critical part of digital signatures and blockchain technology, where they ensure that messages and 
transactions haven’t been altered. In short, hashing provides a simple, reliable way to verify that data remains exactly as 
intended, acting as a digital “tamper detector” for the information we rely on every day.
