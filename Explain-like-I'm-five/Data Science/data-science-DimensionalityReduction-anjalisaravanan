                         Feature Selection – Finding which variables actually matter.


Imagine you built a huge LEGO castle with 1,000 pieces. It has every little detail — doors, windows, towers, and flags. 
That’s a lot of pieces, and it takes a long time to build.

So, you decide to make a smaller version of the same castle using only 100 pieces. 
This version doesn’t have all the tiny details like flags and windows, but it still looks like a castle. 

That’s what dimensionality reduction is about — it takes a big dataset full of detailed information and 
makes a smaller version that still shows the most important parts.

Even though you used fewer LEGO pieces, you can still recognize it as a castle — just 
like we can still understand data even with fewer “pieces” (features).
